We are a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting truth in the digital age. Through innovative technology and community engagement, we identify and counter misinformation while promoting digital literacy and critical thinking.

The Veracitor Alliance combines advanced monitoring systems with human expertise to track and analyze misinformation trends across social media platforms. Our open-source tools enable community fact-checkers and researchers to detect, study, and counter false narratives as they emerge. More on [HOW](directory/page.md)
